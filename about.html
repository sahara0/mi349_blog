            <p>My name is Kevin Shin, a Computer science student enrolled at Michigan State University. My hobbies are playing video games, and my interest is especially in Fighting games. I also play other competitive games such as League of Legends, and Call of Duty. Another hobby of mine is making short videos of my gameplay, whether it be wins or fails.</p>
