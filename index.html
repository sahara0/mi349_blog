            <h2>An analysis of Okizeme</h2>

            <p><img src="okizeme.jpg" alt="An example of Okizeme, where the standing player throws out an attack at the player waking up"></p>
            
            <p>Okizeme is a fundamental situation in most fighting games, and can be used to both the defending and attacking player’s advantage. Okizeme, also known as “Oki” is described as the situation when the player character or the opponent is knocked down. When a player is knocked down, the standing player has a few options that they are able to do, putting pressure on the downed player. In street fighter, such options include “meaty” attacks, which are attacks that do not connect on its first active frames, or performing a slow move before the opponent can respond. With meaty attacks, the standing player is able to do one of several options on the downed player: they can throw an attack, use a grab, or wait and/or guard. The downed player also has a few options: they can use an invincible move on wake up, use a normal attack, do a counter grab, or wait and/or guard. From the standing player’s position, an attack beats a wake up grab, throwing a grab beats guarding, and waiting/guarding beats a wake up invincible move. On the defending player’s side, an invincible move on wake up beats attacks and grabs, using a normal attack beats grabs and some attacks, and a counter grab cancels an attacking grab. Oki essentially creates a game of Rock-Paper-Scissors that the opponent must choose the correct option to prevent further damage or from going into a worse disadvantaged state.</p>

            <h2>An analysis of Dragon Punch</h2>

            <p><img src="shoryuken.png" alt="Ryu from Street Fighter uses Shoryuken"></p>

            <p>Dragon Punch, or more commonly known as “DP”, is a move that some fighting characters can do, known for usually having invincibility at the beginning of the move. The DP is an extremely powerful move that can be used as a relatively safe wake up option, as an anti-air move, or as a combo ender. An example of a DP is Street Fighter’s Shoryuken, a move that several characters in the series use, and where the “Dragon Punch” name came from. Shoryuken is a rising uppercut that has invincibility at the starting frames of the move, making it extremely strong to counter players attacking from the air, or players throwing attacks in Okizeme. In different fighting games, the DP may look different from a Shoryuken, but most that can be called a DP must simply have the invincible property on the move. Such a strong move, however, is not without its drawbacks. If a player guarded an incoming DP, then the player using the DP is at a huge disadvantage, where the guarding player can now use almost any move they wanted as the opponent is left defenseless after the DP’s attack fails. Because of this, players must be wary of opponents waiting to bait out their DPs, or will suffer huge consequences.</p>
